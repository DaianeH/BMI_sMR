-- Get all tables of genes identified in my SMR analysis and merge in one (last column: all names of cohorts where said gene was identified).
-- Get Yengo 138 genes from Summary statistics webpage (excel / txt file Yengo138_BMI_genes) and use overlap.pl (or merge tables?) to merge with those I identified.
-- Put duplicates in the same line
-- Merge this table with the total list of loci identified as significant by Yengo
-- Merge this with the results from Locke et al (last column = Locke et al genes)
