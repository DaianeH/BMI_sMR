sMR analysis on BMI variants

### DATA
eQTL identified by Dobin et al (2018) (Landscape of Conditional eQTL in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and Co-localization with Schizophrenia GWAS): post-mortem human brain samples (n = 467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC)
The CommonMind Consortium sequenced RNA from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia cases (N = 258) and control subjects (N = 279)

Lude Franke: Unraveling the polygenic architecture of complex traits using blood eQTL meta analysis
eQTSs identify key driver genes for polygenic traits: To ascertain the coordinated effects of trait-associated variants on gene expression, we used available GWAS summary statistics to calculate PGSs for 1,263 traits in 28,158 samples. We reasoned that when a gene shows expression levels that significantly correlate with the PGS for a specific trait (an expression quantitative trait score; eQTS), the downstream trans-eQTL effects of the individual risk variants converge on that gene,and hence, that the gene may be a driver of the disease. Our meta-analysis identified 18,210 eQTS effects (FDR < 0.05), representing 689 unique traits (54%) and 2,568 unique genes (13%; Supplementary Table 15, Figure 1A). Only thing found here related to BMI: The downregulated NRG1 (neuregulin 1; strongest eQTS P=4.5×10-7), encodes a well-established growth factor involved in neuronal development and has been
associated to synaptic plasticity57. NRG1 was also positively associated with the PGS for monocyte
levels20 (strongest eQTS P=1.5×10-7), several LDL cholesterol traits (e.g. medium LDL particles44;
strongest eQTS P=6.2×10-8), coronary artery disease33 (strongest eQTS P=1.5×10-6) and body
mass index in females58 (strongest eQTS P=9.2×10-12)".
