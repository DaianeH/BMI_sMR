Take everything that was in the results of SMR and is not on SMR_yengo_merged.bed. Compare to what is already reported on the tab NEW_LOCI. Report it separetely as... as what?

===============


TRYING TO OVERLAP YENGO'S RESULTS WITH ALL BMI SMR RESULTS

sed -i 's/^/chr/' yengo_resultsall.bed
intersectBed -wa -wb -a yengo_resultsall.bed -b SMR_resultsall.bed > SMR_yengo_merged.bed

Only 131 of Yengo's loci had mapped in merge.
204 SNPs from the SMR analysis were mapped in merge. 287 SNPs are in the SMR results, however. Why the remaining 83 were not?


SMR_yengo__genedistance_merged.bed.txt has the merged files up to -500 +500 according to GENE distance.
SMR_resultsall.bed.xlsx has the merged files up to -500 +500 according to topSNP distance.
